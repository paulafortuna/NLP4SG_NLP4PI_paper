In this work we provide a set of NLP for social good related definition. These will serve as base for a quantitative analysis on NLP literature. We use the [NLP Scholar Dataset!](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.lrec-1.109/) and enumerate a set of keywords for annotating the papers as "Explicit NLP4SG" vs "non-explicit NLP4SG".


### Abstract

The range of works that can be considered as developing NLP for social good (NLP4SG) is enormous. While many of them target the identification of hate speech or fake news, there are others that address, e.g., text simplification to alleviate consequences of dyslexia, or coaching strategies to fight depression. However, so far, there is no clear picture of what areas are targeted by NLP4SG, who are the actors, which are the main scenarios and what are the topics that have been left aside. In order to obtain a clearer view in this respect, we first propose a working definition of NLP4SG and identify some primary aspects that are crucial for NLP4SG, including, e.g., tackled areas, ethics, privacy and bias. Then, we draw upon a corpus of around 50,000 articles downloaded from the ACL Anthology. Based on a list of keywords retrieved from the literature and revised in view of the task, we retrieve from this corpus articles that can be considered to be on NLP4SG according to our definition and analyze them. The result of the analysis is a map of the current NLP4SG research and insights concerning the white spots on this map.
